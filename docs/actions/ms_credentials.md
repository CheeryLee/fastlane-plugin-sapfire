# ðŸ”… ms_credentials

Sets Azure AD credentials for further actions. Works only on `windows` platform.

Username should be used from Azure account, not from your Microsoft Partner Center account.
Usually it ends with `example.onmicrosoft.com` domain, where _example_ is a subdomain name that was chosen while creating Azure AD instance.

Call this action before any other actions that uses Azure AD API.

**Warning:** as you may have already noticed, there are some raw arguments: the account password and client secret.
Make sure that your environment is secure enough to work with them and not be at risk of a leak.
Unfortunately, at this moment there is no any other safer way to get an authorization token.
