# ðŸ”¨ nuget_pack

Executes MSBuild to create a NuGet package. This action uses `restore` parameter under the hood to properly create the NuGet resources file.

In most cases _"Pack"_ task will run along with building the binaries. Thus, if there are no any conditions within it, you can skip calling `msbuild` action.
